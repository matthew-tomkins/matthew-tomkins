# Kia ora, I'm Matt 👋

Full-stack developer with a background in operations management and creative industries. Recently completed intensive bootcamp at Dev Academy Aotearoa, now building applications and looking for opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects.

## About Me

My path into development has been anything but linear. After spending years in Auckland's music scene, scaling a startup from garage to commercial factory and managing operations across New Zealand, I realised I wanted to build a career around something I was genuinely passionate about. That led me to web development.

What drives me is the same thing that motivated me in management: building systems that work and watching people grow. Now I'm applying that mindset to code, creating applications that solve real problems while continuing to learn and develop alongside great teams.

## Background

Before development I spent 10+ years in operations management and creative industries:
- **Operations & Compliance Manager** at WashCo managing teams across New Zealand
- **Factory Manager** at Bootleg Jerky scaling production from garage to national distribution
- **Radio & Events** in Auckland's music scene growing community and artist collaboration

This background gives me a different perspective on development. I understand how teams work, how to communicate effectively and how to build systems that scale. Now I'm applying those skills to writing clean code and building applications.
